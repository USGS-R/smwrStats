smwrStats
===========

R functions to support statistical methods in water resources.

##Package Installation
To install the `smwrStats` package:

1. Install R (version 3.0 or greater) from: [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/)

2. Install RStudio from: [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

3. Add the USGS R repository to your "Rprofile" to get automatic updates. Run the following code:
  
  ```r
  rprofile_path = file.path(Sys.getenv("HOME"), ".Rprofile")
  write('\noptions(repos=c(getOption(\'repos\'),
    CRAN=\'https://cloud.r-project.org\',
    USGS=\'https://owi.usgs.gov/R\'))\n',
      rprofile_path, 
      append =  TRUE)

  cat('Your Rprofile has been updated to include GRAN.
    Please restart R for changes to take effect.')
  ```

4. Restart R!

5. In the RStudio "Console" window (usually left or lower-left), run the following command:

  ```r
  install.packages("smwrStats")
  ```
  

6. Update often. Next time you update your packages, `smwrStats` will automatically update:

7. Make sure to keep your version of R up-to-date. CRAN and the USGS repository will only update packages for the most recent version of R, and one version behind that.
